### _A website to view pokemon and their base stats, built using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)_

This app was built with React using the NPM package _create-react-app_, JavaScript, CSS, and hosted on Amazon Web Services [here](https://www.pokepal.app).

Project was created to continue refining skillset. Some of the skills showcased:

- Working with _REST APIs_, using user input to search and pull info from returned JSON.
- _Filtering_ to provide unique class stylings based on the returned types array.
- Using _flexbox_ to ensure a good user experience regardless of desktop or mobile viewing.
- Webhosting, using _Amazon Web Services_ and _Google Domains_ to create the website where the app is hosted.
